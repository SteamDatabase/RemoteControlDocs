# Steam Remote API Documentation

## Introduction
Documentation for the Steam Remote Control API, first documented by [SteamDB](http://steamdb.info/blog/31/) back in October 2013. They later released [another blogpost](http://steamdb.info/blog/37/) with more information and a link to a repository providing some more functionality than that which is in the _headsDown.html_ file provided with Steam as of December 19th.

Credit mostly goes to the SteamDB guys for this, they did all the leg-work. just extracted the information from their [SteamRemoteClient Tool](https://github.com/SteamDatabase/RemoteUI/) and made a nice documentation out of it for my own reference and for the reference of others.

### Contributions Welcome!
If you find an error, want to add something I missed or simply want to add a client library just submit a [pull request](https://github.com/SteamDatabase/RemoteControlDocs/pulls)! Or if you know something is wrong but don't know how to fix it, throw up an [issue](https://github.com/SteamDatabase/RemoteControlDocs/issues)!

## <a name="overview"></a>Overview

### Enabling Remote Control
The remote control has to be enabled in Big Picture's settings.

### Formats
The base URL for all API requests is `https://<your_steam_client_ip>:27037/steam`

Data is sent as GET or POST payloads, and returned as [JSON](http://json.org).

### Errors
Supplying incorrect payload data or using an invalid API call will result in a HTTP `404` Error Code being returned.

### Success Response
Unless otherwise stated, it can be assumed that each API call simply returns a JSON response of the following on a successful call:

```json
{
    "success": true
}
```

## Authentication
The first request you make to the API while in Big Picture will prompt you to authorise the remote client by its device token. Every API request requires the passing of at least a device token as GET, POST or COOKIE data and will therefore not be included in the documentation beyond the below as it assumed you are already including these details appropriately for each request.

### Check Authorization
```
GET /steam/authorized/
```

#### Sample Responses

Authorized

```json
{
   "success": true,
   "data":
   {
       "tenfoot": 0
   }
}

```

Not Authorized

```json
{
   "success": false,
   "error": "authorization_needs_prompt"
}
```

### Authorization Request 
```
POST /steam/authorization/
```

#### Authorization Request Parameters
<table>
    <thead>
        <tr>
            <th>Name</th>

## Buttons
```
POST /steam/button/:button/
```
Simulates the pressing of controller buttons within Steam Big Picture. The buttons are based on an Xbox 360 Gamepad, whether this will change in the future to better reflect the official Steam Controller is unknown.

#### Valid Buttons

The button identifier should be used in place of :button in the POST request above.

## Keyboard
Simulates keyboard functionality within Steam Big Picture.

### Keys
```
POST /steam/keyboard/key/
```
Simulates the key press of functional keys. Cannot be used for typing, this is what [Sequences](#sequences) are for. Rather this can be used to simulate key presses such as enter/return (for sending messages), backspace, space, the F1-12 keys, etc. Only those that provide some functional use are listed in the table below. If any are missed, please feel free to add them.

#### Key Table

            <td>Simulates pressing enter, most likely use is to send a message after entering it using a [Sequence](#sequences) when no controller is plugged in (A button in API does not send a message with no controller connected, though this may just be a bug and fixed in the future).</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td><code>key_backspace</code></td>

## Client Libraries
### Javascript
#### [SteamDB's SteamRemoteClient](https://github.com/SteamDatabase/RemoteUI/blob/master/js/RemoteClient.js)
Primarily made for use with the RemoteUI.html tool (included in the repository), but for non-local access can be easily modified. It's worth noting that the API does not provide an `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` header, let alone one with a wildcard value, so most browsers won't work with it from a different origin without disabling some security features. JSONP doesn't support POST requests, so that option is out the window too.

If you have a library, please do add it above under the necessary language heading (if the language isn't there, add it)!
